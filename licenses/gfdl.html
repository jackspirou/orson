   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
   document, but changing it is not allowed.

  <p>
   <b>0. Preamble.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document &lsquo;&lsquo;free&rsquo;&rsquo; in the sense
   of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
   redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
   noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
   publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
   responsible for modifications made by others.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This License is a kind of
   &lsquo;&lsquo;copyleft&rsquo;&rsquo;, which means that derivative works of
   the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
   G<small>NU</small> General Public License, which is a copyleft license
   designed for free software.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have designed this License in order to use
   it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free
   documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same
   freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
   manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter
   or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Applicability and definitions.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
   distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
   world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
   under the conditions stated herein. The
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Document&rsquo;&rsquo;, below, refers to any such manual or
   work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
   &lsquo;&lsquo;you&rsquo;&rsquo;. You accept the license if you copy, modify
   or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &lsquo;&lsquo;Modified
   Version&rsquo;&rsquo; of the Document means any work containing the Document
   or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &lsquo;&lsquo;Secondary
   Section&rsquo;&rsquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
   Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
   authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to
   related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that
   overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of
   mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
   relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or
   with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
   political position regarding them.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;&lsquo;Invariant
   Sections&rsquo;&rsquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
   the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
   Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
   does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;&lsquo;Cover Texts&rsquo;&rsquo;
   are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or
   Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released
   under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a
   Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &lsquo;&lsquo;Transparent&rsquo;&rsquo;
   copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format
   whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for
   revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
   images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
   widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for
   input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
   discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image
   format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
   that is not &lsquo;&lsquo;Transparent&rsquo;&rsquo; is called
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Opaque&rsquo;&rsquo;.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of suitable formats for Transparent
   copies include plain <small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input
   format, L<small>A</small>T<small>E</small>X input format,
   <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly
   available <small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple
   <small>HTML</small>, PostScript or <small>PDF</small> designed for
   human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include
   <small>PNG</small>, <small>XCF</small>, and
   <small>JPG</small>. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
   be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
   <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> for which the
   <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
   and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small>, PostScript or
   <small>PDF</small> produced by some word processors for output purposes
   only.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;&lsquo;Title Page&rsquo;&rsquo;
   means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages
   as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear
   in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as
   such, &lsquo;&lsquo;Title Page&rsquo;&rsquo; means the text near the most
   prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title, preceding the beginning of
   the body of the text.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;&lsquo;publisher&rsquo;&rsquo;
   means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the
   public.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A section &lsquo;&lsquo;Entitled
   <small>XYZ</small>&rsquo;&rsquo; means a named subunit of the Document
   whose title either is precisely <small>XYZ</small> or contains
   <small>XYZ</small> in parentheses following text that translates
   <small>XYZ</small> in another language. (Here <small>XYZ</small>
   stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Acknowledgements&rsquo;&rsquo;,
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Dedications&rsquo;&rsquo;,
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Endorsements&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
   &lsquo;&lsquo;History&rsquo;&rsquo;.) To &lsquo;&lsquo;Preserve the
   Title&rsquo;&rsquo; of such a section when you modify the Document means
   that it remains a section &lsquo;&lsquo;Entitled
   <small>XYZ</small>&rsquo;&rsquo; according to this definition.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers
   next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document.
   These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
   this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
   implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no
   effect on the meaning of this License.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Verbatim copying.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
   reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
   those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
   control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
   However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you
   distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
   conditions in section 3.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also lend copies, under the same
   conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Copying in quantity.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
   covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&rsquo;s
   license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers
   that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
   the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must
   also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
   front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
   Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
   title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
   verbatim copying in other respects.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the required texts for either cover are
   too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many
   as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of
   the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a
   machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in
   or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
   network-using public has access to download using public-standard network
   protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
   material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
   steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
   that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
   location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
   Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition
   to the public.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is requested, but not required, that you
   contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
   number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
   version of the Document.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>4. Modifications.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:

       that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,

  <p align="justify">
   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice. These titles must be distinct
   from any other section titles.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may add a section Entitled
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Endorsements&rsquo;&rsquo;, provided it contains nothing but
   endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties &#8212; for
   example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
   organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may add a passage of up to five words as
   a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
   the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
   of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
   arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
   cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
   made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
   another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
   previous publisher that added the old one.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author(s) and publisher(s) of the
   Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for
   publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>5. Combining documents.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
   of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
   all their Warranty Disclaimers.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The combined work need only contain one copy
   of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
   with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same
   name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
   publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same
   adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the
   license notice of the combined work.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the combination, you must combine any
   sections Entitled &lsquo;&lsquo;History&rsquo;&rsquo; in the various
   original documents, forming one section Entitled
   &lsquo;&lsquo;History&rsquo;&rsquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Acknowledgements&rsquo;&rsquo;, and any sections Entitled
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Dedications&rsquo;&rsquo;. You must delete all sections
   Entitled &lsquo;&lsquo;Endorsements&rsquo;&rsquo;.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>6. Collections of documents.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may extract a single document from such a
   collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
   insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>7. Aggregation with independent works.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an &lsquo;&lsquo;aggregate&rsquo;&rsquo; if
   the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
   rights of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works
   permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
   apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
   derivative works of the Document.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is
   applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
   than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may
   be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
   electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
   Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
   aggregate.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>8. Translation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices
   in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
   include the original English version of this License and the original
   versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
   the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
   disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a section in the Document is Entitled
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Acknowledgements&rsquo;&rsquo;,
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Dedications&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
   &lsquo;&lsquo;History&rsquo;&rsquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
   its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

   <b>9. Termination.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this
   License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
   to 60 days after the cessation.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular
   copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies
   you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you
   have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
   receipt of the notice.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section
   does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
   rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and
   not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same
   material does not give you any rights to use it.

  <p>
   <b>10. Future revisions of this license.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   <small>GNU</small> Free Documentation License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
   </a>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each version of the License is given a
   distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular
   numbered version of this License &lsquo;&lsquo;or any later
   version&rsquo;&rsquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
   version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this
   License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide
   which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public
   statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose
   that version for the Document.

  <p>
   <b>11. Relicensing.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   &lsquo;&lsquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rsquo;&rsquo; (or
   &lsquo;&lsquo;<small>MMC</small> Site&rsquo;&rsquo;) means any World
   Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides
   prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that
   anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &lsquo;&lsquo;Massive
   Multiauthor Collaboration&rsquo;&rsquo; (or
   &lsquo;&lsquo;<small>MMC</small>&rsquo;&rsquo;) contained in the site
   means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the
   <small>MMC</small> site.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &lsquo;&lsquo;C<small>C</small>-<small>BY</small>-<small>SA</small>&rsquo;&rsquo;
   means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
   Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal
   place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
   versions of that license published by that same organization.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;&lsquo;Incorporate&rsquo;&rsquo; means
   to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another
   Document.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An <small>MMC</small> is
   &lsquo;&lsquo;eligible for relicensing&rsquo;&rsquo; if it is licensed under
   this License, and if all works that were first published under this License
   somewhere other than this <small>MMC</small>, and subsequently
   incorporated in whole or in part into the <small>MMC</small>, (1) had
   no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
   to November 1, 2008.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator of an <small>MMC</small>
   Site may republish an <small>MMC</small> contained in the site under
   <small>CC</small>-<small>BY</small>-<small>SA</small> on the
   same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the
   <small>MMC</small> is eligible for relicensing.

   <b>12. Addendum: How to use this License for your documents.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
   License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
   just after the title page:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p align="justify">
    Copyright &#169; <small>YEAR YOUR NAME</small>. Permission is granted
    to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the
    G<small>NU</small> Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any
    later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
    Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the
    license is included in the section entitled
    &lsquo;&lsquo;G<small>NU</small> Free Documentation
    License&rsquo;&rsquo;.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
   replace the &lsquo;&lsquo;with ... Texts.&rsquo;&rsquo; line with this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p align="justify">
    with the Invariant Sections being <small>LIST THEIR TITLES</small>,
    with the Front-Cover Texts being <small>LIST</small>, and with the
    Back-Cover Texts being <small>LIST</small>.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
   combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
   situation.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your document contains nontrivial examples
   of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under
   your choice of free software license, such as the G<small>NU</small>
   General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
