   <b>0. Overview.</b>

  <p align="justify">
   <i>Orson</i>
   <a href="#moe2014">
    [<small>MOE</small> 2014]
   </a>
   is a small, general purpose programming language, designed to be used by
   individuals and small groups. It emphasizes efficiency, expressiveness, and
   extensibility, allowing access to low level representations of objects like
   that of the programming language C
   <a href="#ker1988">
    [<small>KER</small> 1988].
   </a>
   Its name is not an acronym, so it doesn&rsquo;t appear in capital letters.
   Orson is not named after any person, place, or thing.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orson programs are made up of expressions
   that work in two phases, called <i>transformation</i> and
   <i>execution.</i> During transformation, Orson applies
   <i>forms</i> to produce new expressions. Forms are similar to macros,
   but are written in a lexically scoped applicative language that can perform
   arbitrary computations. During execution, Orson evaluates the expressions
   that were produced during transformation.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orson is currently implemented so that
   transformation occurs at compile time, and execution occurs at run time.
   This allows writing with forms in an abstract and general way, while still
   producing efficient programs. For example, forms can be used as inline
   substitutes for some procedures. Most operators are implemented as forms, so
   they can be redefined. Abstract data types can be implemented as forms that
   take types as their arguments and return types as their results. Control
   structures can be implemented as higher-order forms that take forms as
   arguments and return forms as their results.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orson was developed on Intel <i>x</i>86
   computers running Debian and Ubuntu G<small>NU</small>/Linux, so it
   should work on similar systems. The Orson compiler itself is written in
   G<small>NU</small> C
   <a href="#sta2008">
    [<small>STA</small> 2008].
   </a>
   It translates Orson source programs to equivalent G<small>NU</small> C
   programs, and then invokes the G<small>NU</small> C compiler
   <small>GCC</small> to compile them. Orson is distributed with many
   example programs, most of which are themselves written in Orson. These were
   written to test the Orson language and its compiler.

  <p>
   <b>3. Makefiles.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Orson and many of its accompanying programs are installed by Unix
   <i>makefiles</i>
   <a href="#sta2010">
    [<small>STA</small> 2010].
   </a>
   The next few sections describe how these makefiles compile, install, and
   uninstall programs. I assume only a minimal knowledge of Unix. Readers who
   are familiar with Unix can skip section
   <a href="#root">
    3.1
   </a>
   and skim the rest.
  </p>
  <a name="root">
  </a>
  <p>
   <b>3.1. Root.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Unix systems have a special user (sometimes called the
   <i>superuser</i>) whose name is <i>root.</i> The root user can do
   almost anything without the system objecting. If you&rsquo;re root, you can
   read any file, write any file, delete any file, and make files in any
   directory. You can become root if you have the right password. This is
   potentially dangerous, so you shouldn&rsquo;t become root unless you must,
   and even then you should stay root for as short a time as you can.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must become root to install Orson and the
   programs that accompany it. This is because these programs must be placed in
   directories that you ordinarily aren&rsquo;t allowed to make files in. If
   you can&rsquo;t become root for some reason, or you don&rsquo;t want to,
   then you can still experiment with Orson and its accompanying programs
   without installing them. I&rsquo;ll explain how to do that in section
   <a href="#compile">
    3.4.
   </a>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are at least two different ways to
   become root. On some systems, you become root only for the duration of a
   single command. Suppose you want to execute the command <tt>tenhut</tt>
   as root. Then you type <tt>sudo</tt>&nbsp;<tt>tenhut</tt> to the
   shell, and type a password. (I guess <tt>sudo</tt> stands for <i>su
   do,</i> or maybe it&rsquo;s a pun on the word <i>pseudo.</i>) The
   command <tt>sudo</tt> doesn&rsquo;t explicitly put you into a new
   shell, it just executes <tt>tenhut</tt> as if you&rsquo;re root.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On other systems, you type <tt>su</tt>
   to the shell, then type a password. (I guess <tt>su</tt> stands for
   <i>superuser.</i>) On others, you type
   <tt>su</tt>&nbsp;<tt>root</tt>, or
   <tt>sudo</tt>&nbsp;<tt>su</tt>, or
   <tt>sudo</tt>&nbsp;<tt>su</tt>&nbsp;<tt>root</tt>. This puts
   you into a new shell where you can type commands that are executed as if
   you&rsquo;re root. When you&rsquo;re done, you exit the new shell by typing
   the command <tt>exit</tt> or by typing the character
   <i>control-D.</i>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commands <tt>sudo</tt> and
   <tt>su</tt> may remember the root password for a short time, so you
   don&rsquo;t have to keep typing it if you do several
   <tt>sudo</tt>&rsquo;s or <tt>su</tt>&rsquo;s one after the other.
   You can get more information about <tt>sudo</tt> and <tt>su</tt>
   by typing the commands <tt>man</tt>&nbsp;<tt>sudo</tt> and
   <tt>man</tt>&nbsp;<tt>su</tt> to the shell.
  </p>
  <a name="install">
  </a>
  <p>
   <b>3.2. Installing.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   To install a program, first <tt>cd</tt> to the directory that contains
   the source code for it. There should be a file called <tt>Makefile</tt>
   in that directory. It contains Unix commands that can compile, install, and
   uninstall the program. It also contains comments that describe exactly what
   it will do to your system when you run it. Read <tt>Makefile,</tt> and
   if you&rsquo;ve satisfied yourself that it won&rsquo;t do anything bad, then
   execute the command <tt>make</tt>&nbsp;<tt>install</tt> as root.
   (See section
   <a href="#root">
    3.1
   </a>
   if you don&rsquo;t know how to do that.) The <tt>make</tt> command will
   write a list of the things it&rsquo;s doing to install the program.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the program is installed, you can run
   it. Just type its name to the shell, maybe followed by some options. If you
   don&rsquo;t know what its options are, you can find out by typing the
   command <tt>man</tt>&nbsp;<i>p,</i> where <i>p</i> is the
   name of the program: you should see a manual page for <i>p</i> on the
   screen. If you can&rsquo;t get the manual page, then something has gone
   wrong with the installation. If you can&rsquo;t run the program, then
   something has gone wrong as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3.3. Uninstalling.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   If something did go wrong, or you decide you didn&rsquo;t want to install
   the program after all, then you can uninstall it. Just <tt>cd</tt> to
   the directory that contains the program you installed, and execute the
   command <tt>make</tt>&nbsp;<tt>uninstall</tt> as root. (See
   section
   <a href="#root">
    3.1
   </a>
   if you don&rsquo;t know how to do that.) As before, the <tt>make</tt>
   command will print a list of things it&rsquo;s doing to uninstall the
   program. Once you are no longer root, everything that
   <tt>make</tt>&nbsp;<tt>install</tt> did should be undone.
  </p>
  <a name="compile">
  </a>
  <p>
   <b>3.4. Rootlessness.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   What if you can&rsquo;t become root? Maybe you&rsquo;re a student working in
   a school lab, and you don&rsquo;t have the root password for the computer
   you&rsquo;re using. You can still compile and run these programs. Just
   <tt>cd</tt> to the directory that contains the program you want, and
   type the command <tt>make.</tt> As before, the <tt>make</tt>
   command will print a list of things it&rsquo;s doing to compile the program.
   It will then leave the compiled program in the directory.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if the program you&rsquo;ve just
   compiled is named <i>p,</i> then you can run it by typing the command
   <tt>./</tt><i>p</i> to the shell, maybe followed by some options.
   (That&rsquo;s <i>dot slash pee.</i>) If you don&rsquo;t know what its
   options are, you can read its manual page by typing the command
   <tt>man</tt>&nbsp;<tt>-l</tt>&nbsp;<i>p</i><tt>.1</tt>
   to the shell. (That&rsquo;s <i>man space dash ell space pee dot
   one,</i> so don&rsquo;t confuse a lower case <tt>l</tt> with the
   digit <tt>1.</tt>) You should see the manual page for the program
   <i>p.</i>
