This directory  contains source  code for TLH,  a program that  makes two-level
perfect hash  methods for  large sets of  string keys.  It may be  helpful when
writing lexical scanners  or parsers. TLH is written in  Orson, and is intended
to run  under Unix-like systems, such  as GNU/Linux. These  files contain Orson
source code for TLH.

    array.os     Arrays from the heap.
    hash.os      Convert strings to arbitrary integers.
    key.os       Linear chains of strings used as hash keys.
    main.os      Main program.
    tlh.os       Make a two-level perfect hash method for string keys.
    tree.os      Unbalanced binary search trees of ints.
    write.os     Write results.

These files  contain documentation, sample inputs, and  supporting material for
TLH.  The program canâ€™t currently find a hash method for the strings in egHooks
because hash.os converts two or more of them to the same int.

    Makefile     Compile, install, uninstall TLH.
    README       What you're reading now.
    Readme.by    Bracy source for Readme.html.
    Readme.html  Long HTML version of README.
    egHooks      An example TLH input: Orson hook names (see above).
    egJava       An example TLH input: Java reserved names.
    egOrson      An example TLH input: Orson reserved names.
    tlh.1        Manual page for TLH.

TLH  is available  under the  terms  of the  GNU General  Public License  (GPL)
version 3. An  Orson compiler is also available from the  author under the same
terms.
