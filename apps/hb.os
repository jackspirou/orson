!  HB (How Big) reads source files and writes statistics about how big they are
!  to OUTPUT. For each file it writes the number of blank lines, comment lines,
!  code lines, total lines, length of shortest nonblank line, length of longest
!  nonblank line, and total pages. It ignores directories. The HB command looks
!  like this.
!
!    hb -c σ p₁ p₂ ... pⱼ
!
!  Comment lines begin with the string σ, which defaults to "!" (Orson comments
!  begin with this). The subscripted p's are pathnames of the files to be read.
!  If no pathnames are given, then HB does nothing. HB demonstrates BUFFERs and
!  iterators, among other things.

(load ''lib.command'')    !  Process command line arguments.
(load ''lib.directory'')  !  Operations on Unix directories.

(load ''lib.fail'')       !  Terminate a program with an error message.
(load ''lib.file'')       !  Input and output on Unix file streams.
(load ''lib.text'')       !  Read characters and lines from a text file.
