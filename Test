#
#  ORSON/TEST. Compile Orson source files for debugging.
#
#  James B. Moen
#
#  This file runs the Orson compiler on each Orson source file it can find, and
#  throws away the results, assuming the Orson compiler and library are already
#  installed. It's for debugging after changing the compiler or library.
#

#  Compile the standard prelude in raw (-r) mode.

cd library
echo "orson -r prelude.op"
orson -r prelude.op
rm -f a.out Out.c *.o

#  Compile the Orson library. It does not find all errors, since Orson does not
#  transform a form's body until the form is called.

for x in *.op
do if test $x != prelude.op;
   then echo "orson" $x;
        orson $x;
        rm -f a.out Out.c *.o
   fi
done

for x in *.os
do echo "orson" $x;
   orson $x;
   rm -f a.out Out.c *.o
done

#  Compile all Orson sources in the APPS directory.

cd ../apps

for x in *.os
do echo "orson" $x;
   orson $x;
   rm -f a.out Out.c *.o
