This directory contains  source code for Ox, a  cross-reference generator (also
called a  concordance generator) for Orson  source files. Ox reads  a series of
source files, recording  the names in those files. It then  writes a table that
lists the names in lexicographic order, and the numbers of the lines where they
appear. Ox is written in Orson, and is intended to run under Unix-like systems,
such as GNU/Linux. These files contain Orson source code for Ox.
