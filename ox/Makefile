#  This Makefile assumes that an Orson compiler is installed. An Orson compiler
#  is available for free from the author.
#
#  The following directories are where Ox will be installed.
#
#    PREFIX/BINDIR   Ox will be installed here.
#    PREFIX/MANDIR   The Ox "man" page will be installed here.
#
#  If these directories do not exist, then they will be created.

prefix = /usr/local
bindir = $(prefix)/bin
mandir = $(prefix)/man/man1

#  ALL. Compile Ox, leaving it in the current directory. You must be root to do
#  this.

all:
	orson ox.os
	mv a.out ox

#  CLEAN. Undo the effects of MAKE ALL. You need not be root to do this.

clean:
	rm -f Out.c a.out ox

#  INSTALL. Install Ox.
#
#    1. Make BIN DIRECTORY if it doesn't exist.
#    2. Make MAN DIRECTORY if it doesn't exist.
#    3. Compile Ox.
#    4. Move Ox to BIN DIRECTORY.
#    5. Make root the owner of Ox.
#    6. Let nonroots read and run Ox, but not write it.
#    7. Copy the Ox man page to MAN DIRECTORY.
#    9. Make root the owner of the Ox man page.
#    8. Let nonroots read the Ox man page, but not run or write it.
#
#  You must be root to do this.

install:
	mkdir -p $(bindir)
	mkdir -p $(mandir)
	orson ox.os
	mv a.out $(bindir)/ox
	chown root $(bindir)/ox
	chmod go-w+rx $(bindir)/ox
	cp ox.1 $(mandir)/ox.1
	chown root $(mandir)/ox.1
	chmod go-wx+r $(mandir)/ox.1

#  UNINSTALL. Undo the effects of MAKE INSTALL, by doing these things:
#
#    1. Undo the effects of MAKE ALL.
#    2. Delete Ox from BIN DIRECTORY.
#    3. Delete the Ox man page from MAN DIRECTORY.
#
#  Note that BIN DIRECTORY and MAN DIRECTORY will still exist. You must be root
#  to do this.

	rm -f $(bindir)/ox
	rm -f $(mandir)/ox.1
